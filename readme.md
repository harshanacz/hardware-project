## Features

### 1. Temperature Monitoring
- The system checks the temperature using a DS18B20 sensor.
- If the temperature is 31Â°C or higher, or if it's between 6:00 AM and 12:00 PM, specific actions are triggered.

### 2. Water Level Measurement
- Ultrasonic sensors measure water height at regular intervals.
- If the water level is below a certain threshold, actions are taken to refill or maintain the water level.

### 3. Light Intensity Monitoring
- Photodiodes monitor light intensity in the surroundings.
- Based on light conditions, the system adjusts certain parameters or activates/deactivates components.

### 4. Relay Control
- Relays control various devices such as pumps, heaters, or lights.
- Depending on the temperature, water level, and light intensity, relays are activated or deactivated.

### 5. Servo Motor Activation
- A servo motor performs specific actions at predefined intervals, such as opening or closing a valve.

### 6. Time-Based Actions
- Certain actions are triggered based on the time of day, such as turning on lights at night or activating specific devices during specific hours.

## Technical Overview

### Initialization
- Necessary libraries are included and pin connections are defined for different sensors, actuators, and modules.
- Communication interfaces, such as OneWire for the DS18B20 sensor and I2C for the RTC DS3231, are set up.

### Setup Function
- Serial communication is initialized.
- Pin modes are set, and sensors and actuators are initialized.

### Loop Function
- Continuously performs the following tasks:
  - Measures water height using ultrasonic sensors and prints the distance to the serial monitor.
  - Measures temperature using the DS18B20 sensor and prints the temperature.
  - Measures light intensity using photodiodes, calculates output values, and prints them.
  - Controls relays based on conditions, including time of day and sensor readings.
  - Controls the servo motor to perform an action every minute.
  - Implements various control logic based on sensor readings and time conditions.
  - Delays for a certain period between iterations.
