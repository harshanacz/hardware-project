## Overview:

This ESP32 control system is designed to automate various tasks based on environmental conditions and time of day. Here's a simplified overview of how it operates:

1. **Temperature Check:**
   - At predefined intervals, the system checks the temperature using a DS18B20 sensor.
   - If the temperature is 31Â°C or higher, or if it's between 6:00 AM and 12:00 PM, certain actions are triggered.

2. **Water Level Measurement:**
   - Ultrasonic sensors are used to measure water height at regular intervals.
   - If the water level is below a certain threshold, actions are taken to refill or maintain the water level.

3. **Light Intensity Monitoring:**
   - Photodiodes are employed to monitor light intensity in the surroundings.
   - Based on the light conditions, the system adjusts certain parameters or activates/deactivates components.

4. **Relay Control:**
   - Relays are used to control various devices such as pumps, heaters, or lights.
   - Depending on the temperature, water level, and light intensity, relays are activated or deactivated.

5. **Servo Motor Activation:**
   - A servo motor is controlled to perform specific actions at predefined intervals, such as opening or closing a valve.

6. **Time-Based Actions:**
   - Certain actions are triggered based on the time of day, such as turning on lights at night or activating specific devices during specific hours.

This system offers automation and control capabilities for a variety of applications, providing convenience and efficiency in managing environmental conditions and tasks.


## Technical Overview:

This project involves controlling various components using an ESP32 microcontroller. Here's a brief overview of what happens in the code:

- The code starts by initializing necessary libraries and defining pin connections for different sensors, actuators, and modules.
- It sets up communication interfaces, such as OneWire for DS18B20 sensor, I2C for RTC DS3231, and digital pins for controlling relays, ultrasonic sensors, LED, and servo motor.
- In the `setup()` function, it initializes serial communication, sets pin modes, and initializes sensors and actuators.
- The `loop()` function continuously performs the following tasks:
  - Measures water height using ultrasonic sensors and prints the distance to the serial monitor.
  - Measures temperature using the DS18B20 sensor and prints the temperature.
  - Measures light intensity using photodiodes, calculates output values, and prints them.
  - Controls relays based on certain conditions, including time of day and sensor readings.
  - Controls the servo motor to perform an action every minute.
  - Implements various control logic based on sensor readings and time conditions.
  - Delays for a certain period between iterations.
